This is Prof. Gaston Sanchez's companion website to [STAT 20 Introduction to Probability and Statistics](https://stat20.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley.

The main purpose of this _satellite_ website is to simply host the slides that 
I use while teaching this class, and to make them available to the students in 
my section(s). Students from other sections, as well as teaching staff 
(e.g., fellow instructors, tutors, readers), are welcome to use/read them too.

Please note that I've customized the original slides---of the official website---in 
a way that better suits my teaching style.
