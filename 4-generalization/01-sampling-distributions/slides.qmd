# Populations and Samples

## Interested in

Often we want to know something about the population:

- Proportion of female fish (out of all fish)

- Proportion of male fish (out of all fish)

- Average weight (of all fish)

- Average number of fins (of all fish)

. . .

We call these [Parameters]{.hilit}


## Typical limitations

But we don't have access to all of its individuals

- Hard to observe population

- Not enough time

- Not enough money

- Not enough resources

- ETC

## From the sample ...

We can catch some fish and calculate:

- Proportion of female fish (in sample)

- Proportion of male fish (in sample)

- Average weight (in sample)

- Average number of fins (in sample)

. . .

We call these [Statistics]{.hilit}

# Estimation

## Estimating Parameters

Estimate parameters:

- population mean
- population proportion

\

BTW:

- We never estimate statistics
- Watch out for estimation errors


## Sampling (in practice) {.nostretch}

## Sources of Error: Bias and Variance

## Types of Bias

::: {.fragment}
- [Selection Bias:]{.hilit} When not all units in the population are equally likely to be selected for the sample.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [Measurement Bias:]{.hilit} When your process of measuring a variable systematically misses the target in one direction.

    + when questions are confusingly worded or leading, 
    + when respondents may not be comfortable answering honestly.
:::

::: {.fragment}
- [Non-response Bias:]{.hilit} When certain units originally selected for the sample fail to provide data
:::

::: {.fragment}
Solution (ideal): Simple Random Sample (SRS)
:::


## Types of Variation

::: {.fragment}
- [Sampling Variability:]{.hilit} the variability from one sample to the next
:::

\

::: {.fragment}
- [Measurement Variability:]{.hilit} When we take multiple measurements on the same object and we get variations in measurements from one sample to the next.

# Sampling Distribution

## What is a Sampling Distribution?

Sampling Distribution is the distribution of a statistic upon repeated sampling.

\

No longer are we considering the (usually unknowable) distribution of the population or the observed distribution of the data 

\

Usually the sampling distribution is a hypothetical thing: what would our statistic have looked like if we had taken a different sample of data?
