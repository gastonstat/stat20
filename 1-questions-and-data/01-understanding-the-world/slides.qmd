# Introductions

-   Let us first introduce ourselves!

# {{< fa pen-to-square >}} Introductions {background-color="#00403d"}

-   In groups of 3, take turns introducing yourselves to one another by providing the info listed on the handout (your name, hometown, etc).

-   Each person should finish with a handout filled-in with info on their groupmates. *Make sure you save this for next week!*

## Takeaways from this exercise

We can call the process of:

-   having a question,

. . .

-   finding data to investigate that question,

. . .

-   reaching a conclusion,

. . .

-   and then thinking of a next step which starts everything over again

. . .

-   the *data science lifecycle*.

This lifecycle involves **constructing and critiquing claims made using data**: which is the main goal of our course!

# Types of Claims

<!-- Also: the use of a particular data set to draw a conclusion about the nature of the mechanism that generated the data. -->

Using data collected from students in Stat 20 (Fall 2025), the proportion of UC Berkeley students born in California is 75%.

\

> A claim that changing the value of one variable will influence the value of another variable.
:::
:::::

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Data from a Randomized Controlled Experiment shows that lab scores of STAT 20 students who attend Group Tutoring sessions are 20% higher than those who don't.

## 

::::: columns

![](images/prediction.png)
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
\

> A guess about the value of an unknown variable, based on other known variables.

. . .

\
\

*Example*\
Based on STAT 20 data from the past three semesters, I predict that the median score on quiz 1 will be 80%.

# Practice Concept Questions

## Practice Concept Questions

We will now re-examine a few pathways in the *data science lifecycle*:

-   Forming a question -\> collecting data

. . .

-   Collecting data -\> making a claim

## The AeroFlex Shoe

"Peak Performance" is a fictional company which sells athletic gear, and is launching a brand new shoe, the **AeroFlex**, designed for track-and-field runners, claiming to improve performance.

:::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
![](images/aeroflex.png){fig-alt="AeroFlex shoe prototype." fig-align="center"}
:::
::::

## The AeroFlex Shoe (cont'd)

The company's marketing team has access to data from various sources:

-   <u>Market Research</u>: Data from a survey of 500 local runners before the shoe's official launch.

-   <u>Experiment data</u>: Results from a controlled experiment with a test group of 40 university track-and-field athletes.

-   <u>Sales data</u>: Figures from the first year of sales, categorized by region.

-   <u>Customer feedback</u>: Online reviews and ratings submitted by purchasers.

## Claims

Based on the survey results of 500 local runners, the company states:

> "We are confident that if all local runners were to try the AeroFlex prototype, their average satisfaction rating would be between 4.0 and 4.4 stars."

::: poll
What kind of claim is this: a summary, a prediction, a generalization, or a causal claim?

## Claims

Based on the sales data and customer feedback, the company states:

> For every 0.1-star increase in the average online rating for the AeroFlex shoe, monthly sales will increase by 500 units.

# Intro to R and RStudio

-   Go to the course website: <https://stat20.berkeley.edu/fall-2025/>

-   Click on the **Assignments** tab

-   Click on **Lab 1: Part II**.

## Intro to R and RStudio (cont'd)

We will now

-   Demo the four parts of RStudio
-   Show you how to work with a Quarto Document
-   Walk through the first few questions of Lab 1

## Components of RStudio

1.  Console

2.  Environment

3.  Editor

4.  File Directory

> Now we are going to switch over to RStudio to understand these 4 components a bit better.

## Components of RStudio

1.  **Console**: Where the live R session lives. Type commands into the prompt `>` and press enter/return to run them. The Console is in the lower-left pane.

2.  **Environment**: The space that keeps track of all of the data and objects that you have created or loaded and have access to. Found in the upper right pane.

3.  **Editor**: Used to compose and edit text (.qmd files) and R code (.r files). Found in the upper left pane.

4.  **File Directory**: Used to navigate between your files/folders on your Rstudio account. Can move, copy, rename, delete, etc. Found in the lower right pane.

## R as a calculator

R allows all of the standard arithmetic operations.

**Multiplication**

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 * 2 
```

**Division**

```{r}
#| echo: true

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Parentheses for Order of Ops.**

```{r}
#| echo: true
2 ^ 3 + 1
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
