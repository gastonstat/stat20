# STAT 20 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics

- __Description__: This course is designed primarily as a basic introductory course for statistical thinking. It is not very mathematical. Neither linear algebra nor calculus is required, although some concepts seem more natural if you've taken these courses. You do need to be comfortable with math at the level of high-school algebra (e.g., the equation of a straight line, plotting points, taking powers and roots, percentages). The middle of the course involves a fair amount of combinatorics—counting.

- The emphasis of the course is critical thinking about quantitative evidence. Topics include reasoning and fallacies, descriptive statistics, association, correlation, regression, elements of probability, set theory, chance variability, random variables, expectation, standard error, sampling, hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, experiments and observational studies, as well as common techniques of presenting data in misleading ways.

## 1.1 What is Data?

:card_index: __ABOUT__:

We begin by talking about "Data". For the scope of this course, we'll think of "Data" as a set of individuals and variables that give us information about those individuals. An individual can be an object or a person. A variable is an attribute, such as a measurement or a label.

    - Difference between qualitative and quantitative variables



## 1.2 Summarizing Data Graphically

:card_index: __ABOUT__:

One of the first steps in data analysis is to explore each variable in a data set (i.e. univariate analysis). A common tool used for such exploration is to create a graph of the distribution of the variable. One kind of graph is the so-called __histogram__ which is a visual display of the distribution of a quantitative variable. Histograms are particularly useful for large data sets. A histogram divides the variable values into equal-sized intervals. We can see the number of individuals in each interval.

## 2.1 Measures of Center: Mean and Median

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

Recall that when we describe the distribution of a quantitative variable, we describe the overall pattern (shape, center, and spread) in the data and deviations from the pattern (outliers). In this section, we expand our discussion about the notion of __center__. The idea is to determine, in a mathematical way, a typical value in the distribution, with the goal of using such a single value to represent the entire group.

## 2.2 Measures of Spread

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

In this section, we expand our discussion about the notion of __spread__. To be more precise, we'll focus on one kind of spread: __standard deviation__. This is a measure of variability when we use the mean as a measure of center.

## 4.2 Regression

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

So far we have used a scatterplot to describe the relationship between two quantitative variables. We then focused on linear relationships and the use of correlation as a measure of the direction and strength of the linear relationship. Our focus on linear relationships continues here. We will 1) use lines to make predictions, and 2) develop a measurement for identifying the best line to summarize the data.

## 5.1 Prediction Errors

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

We need to look at how the predictions from a given line compare to observed data. This involves defining a residual to be the amount of error in a prediction. Next, we create residual plots. A residual plot with no pattern reassures us that our linear model is a good summary of the data.

## 6.1 Probability Rules (part 1)

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. When we say that an event is random or due to chance, we mean that the event is unpredictable in the short run but has a regular and predictable behavior in the long run.

## 7.1 Binomial Distribution

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

In probability theory and statistics, the binomial distribution with parameters _n_ and _p_ is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of _n_ independent trials. The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size _n_ drawn with replacement from a population of size _N_.

    - Binomial Formula
    - Calculate the chance that an even t will occur exactly _k_ times out of _n_


## 7.2 The Law of Averages

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

In this section, the idea is to talk about chance processes; simply put, this can be approached by considering a list of numbers each of which is associated with a given probability. Interestingly, we can use a so-called _box model_ to represent a population, as well as to study sampling procedures.

<br>

:book: __READING__: 

- FPP, chap 16: The Law of Averages

<br>

:pencil2: __TOPICS__:

	- How many draws?

## 8.1 Expected Value and Standard Error

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

We now focus on the mean and standard deviation of a discrete random variable. We discuss how to calculate these measures of center and spread for this type of probability distribution, but in practice we will use software to do these calculations.

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

When a chance process generates a number, the expected value and standar error are a guide to where the number will be. But the probability histogram gives a complete picture. This visual display is not supposed to represent data, instead it represents chance.

## 9.2 Sampling Distributions

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

We know that a parameter is a number that describes a population. In turn, a statistic is a number that describes a sample. Obviously, random samples vary, so we need to understand how much they vary and how they relate to the population. Our ultimate goal is to create a probability model that describes the long-run behavior of sample measurements. We use this model to make inferences about the population.

    - Describing the long-run behavior of statistics from random samples
    - Usually a parameter cannot be determined exactly, but can only be __estimated__ by a statistic
    - When estimating a parameter, one major issue is accuracy: how close is the estimate close to be?

## 10.1 Estimating a Population Proportion

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

When our goal is to estimate a population proportion, we select a random sample from the population and use the sample proportion as an estimate. Of course, random samples vary, so we want to include a statement about the amount of error that may be present. Because sample proportions vary in a predictable way, we can also make a probability statement about how confident we are in the process we used to estimate the population proportion.

<br>

:book: __READING__: 

- FPP, chap 21: The Accuracy of Percentages

<br>

:pencil2: __TOPICS__:

+ __Estimating Proportions__
    - Describe the sampling distribution for sample proportions
    - Sample statistics vary, so there is always error in our estimate
    - We use the standard error, which is the average error in our sample estimates, to create a margin of error
    - In turn, we use a margin of error to build a confidence interval to estimate a population proportion


-----

    - Interpret the meaning of a confidence level associated with a confidence interval.
    - Adjust the margin of error by making changes to the confidence level or sample size.


-----


## 12.1 Hypothesis Tests

:card_index: __ABOUT__: 

In inference, we use a sample to draw a conclusion about a population. Two types of inference are the focus of our work in this course: 1) Estimate a population parameter with a confidence interval; 2) Test a claim about a population parameter with a hypothesis test.

Now we look at how to test a claim with a hypothesis test. Statistical investigations begin with research questions. We begin our discussion of hypothesis tests with research questions that require us to test a claim. Later we look at how a claim becomes a hypothesis.
