## Expected Value of a Discrete RV

$$
E(X) = \sum_x x \times P(X=x) = \mu
$$

EV is the long-term average: the value that you would expected to get if you were to repeat the chance process a very large number of times.


## Variance of a Discrete RV

$$
\text{Var}(X) = \sum_x (x - \mu)^2 \times P(X=x)
$$

Var is the _average squared deviation from the mean_ (measures the typical spread around EV)


## Example: Expected Value

Let $X$ be the spots when we roll a fair six-sided die.

. . .

$$
\Omega = \left \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \right \}
$$

. . .

$$
P(X = x) = 1/6, \quad \text{for all } x
$$

. . .

$$
\begin{align*}
EV(X) &= \sum_x x \times P(X=x) \\
&= 1(1/6) + 2(1/6) + 3(1/6) + 4(1/6) + 5(1/6) + 6(1/6) \\
&= \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} \\
&= 3.5
\end{align*}
$$

## Example: Variance

Let $X$ be the spots when we roll a fair six-sided die.

$$
\Omega = \left \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \right \}
$$

. . .

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Var}(X) &= \sum_x (x - \mu)^2 \times P(X=x) \\
&= (1 - 3.5)^2 (1/6) + (2 - 3.5)^2 (1/6) + \dots + (6 - 3.5)^2 (1/6) \\
&= \frac{(1 - 3.5)^2 + (2 - 3.5)^2 + (6 - 3.5)^2}{6} \\
& \approx 2.916
\end{align*}
$$


## Properties of EV

$E(c) = c$

\

. . .

$E(cX) = c \cdot E(X)$

\

. . .

$E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$

\

. . .

$E(aX + bY) = a \cdot E(X) + b \cdot E(Y)$

\

. . .

$Y = g(X) \ \rightarrow \ E(Y) = E(g(X)) = \sum_x g(x) \times P(X=x)$


## Properties of Variance

$\textit{Var}(c) = 0$

\

. . .

$\textit{Var}(cX) = c^2 \cdot \textit{Var}(X)$

\

. . .

$\textit{Var}(X + c) = \textit{Var}(X)$

\

. . .

$\textit{Var}(X + Y) = \textit{Var}(X) + \textit{Var}(Y) \quad \text{ for } X, Y \text{ indep}$

\

. . .

$\textit{Var}(X - Y) = \textit{Var}(X) + \textit{Var}(Y) \quad \text{ for } X, Y \text{ indep}$


# Concept Review

##

Let $X$ be a random variable such that
$$
X = \begin{cases}
			-1, & \text{ with probability } 1/3\\
            0, &  \text{ with probability } 1/6\\
            1, &  \text{ with probability } 4/15 \\
            2, & \text{ with probability } 7/30 \\
		 \end{cases}
$$

(a) Draw the graph of the CDF of $X$ 

:::{.notes}
write down pmf with denominator 30, and draw cdf on the board. 
P(X = -1)= 5/30, P(X = 0)= 10/30,  P(X = 1)= 8/30, P(X = 2)= 7/30

(b) Compute the expected value and variance of $X$

:::{.notes}
write down pmf with denominator 30, and draw cdf on the board. 
P(X = -1)= 5/30, P(X = 0)= 10/30,  P(X = 1)= 8/30, P(X = 2)= 7/30
E(X) = (-1)(5/30) + 0(10/30) + 1(8/30) + 2(7/30)
(-10 + 0 + 8 + 14)/30 = 12/30 = 2/5
Var(X) = E(X^2) - 4/25 = (10 + 0 + 8 +28)/30 -4/25 = 23/15- 4/25 ~~ 1.37333
Graph the pmf and mark the expectation
The numbers are not pretty but the point is to show them the computation and graph
The rest of the ideas can be recapped as you go over the concept questions
You may want to review linearity of expectation here, or save it for when going over the PS

# Concept Questions

##

$X$ is a random variable with the distribution shown below:
$$
X = \begin{cases}
 3, \; \text{ with prob } 1/3\\
 4, \; \text{ with prob } 1/4\\
 5, \; \text{ with prob } 5/12
 \end{cases}
$$

Consider the box with tickets:  $\fbox{3}\, \fbox{3}\, \fbox{3} \,\fbox{4}  \,\fbox{4} \,\fbox{4} \,\fbox{4} \,\fbox{5} \,\fbox{5}\, \fbox{5} \,\fbox{5} \,\fbox{5}$ 

Suppose we draw once from this box and let $Y$ be the value of the ticket drawn. 

:::{.poll}
Which random variable has a higher expectation?
:::

:::{.notes}
This is a reading question. Note that the pmf implied by the box is not the same as the given pmf. In the box, 4 has a higher probability, so the average is higher. They do not need to actually do the computation.
At this point, ask them what box would they use so that if $X$ is the value of a randomly selected ticket, the distribution of $X$ is exactly the distribution shown here.

Prof. Stoyanov's Zoom office hours are not too crowded this spring. She observes that number of Stat 20 students coming to her Thursday office hours have a Poisson(2) distribution. There is one Data 88 student from a previous semester who is *always* there (they want a letter of recommendation). 

:::{.poll}
What is the expected value (EV) and variance (V) of the number of students in her Zoom office hours?
:::

:::{.notes}
This is also a reading question, with < 50% getting it right. 
Let $X$ be the number of Stat 20 students who go to the office hours. Then $E(X) = 2 = Var(X)$.
But the number of students in the office is $X+1$ since that one student is always there. 
$E(X+1) = 2+1 = 3$ and $Var(X+1) = Var(X) = 2$

Let $X$ be a discrete uniform random variable on the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. 

:::{.poll}
If $Y=X^2$, what is $E(Y)$?
:::



##

Let $X$ be a discrete uniform random variable on the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. 

:::{.poll}
If $W = \min(X, 0.5)$, what is $E(W)$?
:::

:::{.notes}
begin by asking them what is What is $E(X)$? And pointing out that if we have a symmetric distribution then EX is in the middle. Emphasize the idea of it being a "typical" value and an average or a mean. This is so they practice computing the EV of a function of a rv. Have them make a table (or perhaps you draw a table) of $X$, $Y$, $W$ and $f(x)$

Evgeni bakes a cake and invites two friends to join him in eating it. The cake will be evenly split between whoever shows up and Evgeni. His friends know that Evgeni is an erratic baker at best, and independently each toss a coin to decide whether they will go or not. Let $X$ be the **fraction** of the cake that Evgeni gets to eat. For example if 1 friend shows up, Evgeni gets half the cake, if 2 show up, he gets one-third of the cake. What is $E(X)$?

A die will be rolled $n$ times and the object is to guess the total number of spots in $n$ rolls, and you choose $n$ to be either 50 or 100. There is a one-dollar penalty for each spot that the guess is off. For instance, if you guess 200, and the total is 215, then you lose 15 dollars. Which do you prefer? 50 throws, or 100?*

:::{.poll}
Which do you prefer? $n = 50$ rolls, or $n = 100$ rolls?
:::

<font size="5"> * From the text *Statistics* by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves </font>

:::{.notes}
Prefer 50 because the square root law tells us the the spread of the distribution will be smaller for fewer rolls. If we were computing the *average* number of spots, then we would pick larger $n$ since $\sqrt{n}$ goes in the denominator of SE.

One hundred draws will be made with replacement from a box with tickets $\fbox{0}\, \fbox{2}\, \fbox{3} \,\fbox{4}  \,\fbox{6}$. Which of the following statements are true? *

:::{.poll}
- The expected value of the sum of the one hundred draws is 300, give or take 20 or so. 
- The expected value of the sum of the one hundred is 300.
- The sum of the one hundred draws is 300, give or take 20 or so. 
- The sum of the one hundred draws is 300.
:::

<font size="5"> * From the text *Statistics* by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves </font>



:::{.notes}
The EV is a constant, and note that the box average is (0+2+3+4+6)/5 = 3, so the EV of a single draw is 3, and the EV of the sum of 100 draws is $100\times 4 = 300$. The give or take number given here is the box SD $\times 10 = 2\times 10 = 20$. You can let $X$ be a random variable that is the value of **one** ticket drawn at random from this box, and then we want $S_{100}$. This can be boardwork.

We have two random variables: $X \sim$ Binomial($10, 0.2$) and  $Y$ is the random variable that is the value of one ticket drawn at random from a box with tickets $\fbox{0}\, \fbox{2}\, \fbox{3} \,\fbox{4}  \,\fbox{6}$. 

We take the sum of 100 iid random variables for each of $X$ and $Y$, called $SX_{100}$ and $SY_{100}$. The empirical distributions of  $SX_{100}$ and $SY_{100}$  are plotted below.

library(patchwork)

emp_sx = replicate(100000, sum(rbinom(100, 10, 0.2)))

p1 <- data.frame(emp_sx) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = emp_sx, y=..density..)) +

box <- c(0,2,3,4,6)

emp_sy <- replicate(100000, sum(sample(box, 100, replace = TRUE)))

p2 + p1

:::{.poll}
Which distribution belongs to which random variable?

:::{.notes}
They need to remember that the expected value of S_x will be 200, and for S_y 300.

# Visualizing probability distributions

Recall `geom_bar()`. What does it do? What aesthetics do we need to define?

```r
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) + 
geom_bar(fill = "steelblue4") + theme_minimal() 
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-align: center
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) + geom_bar(fill = "steelblue4") + theme_minimal()

```
## 

What about if we don't want to count instances but want to *plot* probabilities? 

Let $X$ be the number of heads when we toss a fair coin three times. We know that:

$$
X = \begin{cases}
			0, & \text{ with probability } 1/8\\
            1, &  \text{ with probability } 3/8\\
            2, &  \text{ with probability } 3/8 \\
            3, & \text{ with probability } 1/8 \\
		 \end{cases}
$$
To plot this, we use a special kind of bar chart, plotted using `geom_col()`, in which the bar heights represent *values* supplied by the data. We have to specify a `y` aesthetic, a column from the data. The values from this column will be the heights of the bars.

##

```r
x <- c(0, 1, 2, 3)
fx <- c(1/8, 3/8, 3/8, 1/8)
coin3_df <- data.frame(x, fx)
coin3_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(x), y = fx)) +
geom_col(fill = "goldenrod2") + ???
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-align: center
x <- c(0, 1, 2, 3)
fx <- c(1/8, 3/8, 3/8, 1/8)
coin3_df <- data.frame(x, fx)
coin3_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = factor(x), y = fx)) +
geom_col(fill = "goldenrod2") + labs(x = "Values taken by X", y = "P(X = x)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
