## Random variables

Let $X$ be the number of heads in three tosses of a fair coin. What is the distribution of $X$? That is, what is $f(x) = P(X = x)$? What values will $x$ take?

## Random variables

What about if $X$ is the number of heads in 3 tosses of a **biased** coin, where the chance of heads is $\frac{2}{3}$? Now what is $f(x) = P(X = x)$?

## Random variables

Now suppose we toss a fair coin until the first time it lands heads, and let $X$ be the number of tosses (including the last one, which is the first time the coin lands heads). What is the pmf of $X$? Is it binomial?

## Random variables

Finally, let's consider a deck of cards, and we are interested in the number of hearts dealt in a hand of five. Call this number $X$. What is the pmf of $X$?

## Demo

Demo `dbinom()` and `pbinom()` and connection to pmf and cdf. Show how we can use rbinom to get an empirical histogram for three flips of fair or biased coin.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
# Binomial: parameters
n = 3   # number of tosses
p = 2/3 # chance of heads

# probability distribution
dbinom(x = 0:n, size = n, prob = p)
```

## Demo

Show how we can use rbinom to get an empirical histogram for three flips of fair or biased coin.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment
# Binomial: parameters
n = 3   # number of tosses
p = 2/3 # chance of heads

# simulation (100 tosses of biased coin)
tosses = rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = p)
tosses
```

Empirical Probability Distribution

data.frame(tosses) |> 
  count(tosses) |> 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))
```

#| echo: true

  ggplot(aes(x = tosses, y = prop)) +

```

## $f(x)$ and $F(x)$

::: incremental
-   $f(x)$ is the probability mass function of $X$. What does that mean? What is the connection to the distribution table? The probability histogram?

-   $F(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function.

-   What is the connection between $f$ and $F$?

## Example

Box with tickets: { 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2 }.

Draw one ticket, and let $X$ be the value of the ticket.

Draw an example on the board. Maybe box of tickets { 0, 0, 0 , 1, 1, 2, 2, 2} draw one ticket, and let $X$ be the value of the ticket. Write out both $f(x)$ and $F(x)$ in function notation, then draw the cdf and show how we can get from the cdf to the pmf.

# Concept Question 1

##  {.nostretch}

Roll a pair of fair six-sided dice and let $X = 1$ if the dice land showing the same number of spots, and $0$ otherwise. For example, if both dice land $2$, then $X = 1$, but if one lands $2$ and the other lands $3$, then $X = 0$.

::: poll
What is the cdf $F(x)$?
:::

::: notes
The chance that $X = 1$ can be broken up into six mutually exclusive situations, that the dice both show one spot, or both show two spots, etc. Each of these has probability $1/36$ so the total probability by the addition rule is $6/36 = 1/6$

You have $10$ people with a cold and you have a remedy with a $20\%$ chance of success. What is the chance that your remedy will cure at least *one* sufferer? (Let $X$ be the number of people cured among the 10. We are looking for the probability that $X \ge 1$)

::: poll
What is the chance that at least one person is cured?
:::

::: notes
$P(X \ge 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X = 0) = 1 - (1-p)^{10}$, where $p = 0.2$, because $X \sim Bin(10, p)$. $1-p = 0.8 \: \& \: 1-0.8^{10} = 0.8926$

There are 4 histograms of different Poisson distributions below. Match each distribution to its parameter $\lambda$. Recall that $\lambda$ is how many occurrences we think will happen in a given period of time.

$$
(1)\: \lambda = 0.5 \hspace{2cm} (2)\: \lambda = 1 \hspace{2cm} (3) \: \lambda = 2 \hspace{2cm} (4) \: \lambda = 4\hspace{2cm}
