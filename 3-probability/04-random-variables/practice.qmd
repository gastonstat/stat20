## 2) Tossing a fair coin

Let $X$ be the number of heads in five tosses of a fair coin. We are interested in finding the probability distribution of $X$, that is: $P(X = k)$

a) What values will $k$ take?

b) Use `dbinom()` to find the probability distribution of $X$. In other words, 
obtain the values of $P(X = k)$ for all values of $k$.

c) Sketch a graph of the probability histogram of $X$.

d) Sketch a graph of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F(x)$.

## 5) Rolling a pair of dice

Consider two colored 6-sided dice: one of them is a blue die, and the other is 
a red die. You roll the dice, and look at the numbers on their top faces. 
Let $W$ be a random variable that takes the following values:

- $W = -1$  if the number in the blue die is less than the number in the red die.
- $W = 0$   if the number in the blue die is equal to the number in the red die.
- $W = 1$   if the number in the blue die is greater than the number in the red die.

For example, if the blue die lands 3 and the red lands 5, then $W$ = -1. If both dice land 2, then $W$ = 0. If the blue die lands 4 and the red lands 1, then $W$ = 1.

Below is a sketch of the cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F(w)$.

![](images/sketch-cdf.png){fig-align="center" width=80%}

Based on $F(w)$, find the probabilities:

a) $P(W = -1)$

b) $P(W = 0)$

c) $P(W = 0.5)$

d) $P(W = 1)$


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Show answers

a) $P(W = -1) = 15/36$

b) $P(W = 0) = 21/36 - 15/36 = 6/36$

c) $P(W = 0.5) = 0$

d) $P(W = 1) = 1 - 21/36 = 15/36$

## 6) Rolling a pair of dice (cont'd)

Refer to the colored dice of the previous problem. Let $V$ be a random variable that takes the following values:

- $V = 0$ if both dice land on even numbers.
- $V = 1$ if both dice land on odd numbers.
- $V = 2$ if one die is even, and the other is odd (regardless of color).


a) Find $P(V = 0)$

b) Find $P(V = 1)$

c) Find $P(V = 2)$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Show answers

a) $P(V = 0) = 9/36$

b) $P(V = 1) = 9/36$

c) $P(V = 2) = 18/36$
