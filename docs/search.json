We see that at the beginning, for a small number of tosses, the proportion of times that the coin lands heads is all over the place, but it eventually settles down to be around 0.5. This verifies our intuition that if we toss a fair coin, the proportion of times that the coin lands heads should be about 0.5. This idea of the probability of a particular outcome as a long run proportion of times that we see that outcome is called the frequentist theory of probability, and we will be using this theory in our class. (A different theory of probability uses a subjective notion of probability, but we won‚Äôt get into that at this time.) We will think about the probability of heads as the long-run relative frequency, or the proportion of times the coin will land heads if we toss it many, many times. This fits with our intuition that if we have a fair coin, that means that each of the two possible outcomes will occur roughly the same number of times when we toss it over and over again. This is the justification for calling the two outcomes equally likely and allowing us to define the probability of heads to be 1/2."
